            <details>
                <summary>What are movement modes?</summary>
                <p>
                    Movement modes control the behavior of vehicles in the simulation.<br />
                    The mode <b>MANUAL</b> makes a vehicle strictly follow a list of points.
                    It drives from position to position as precise as possible recognizing target speeds and speed limits.
                    But it ignores any lanes, obstacles or other participants.<br />
                    The mode <b>AUTONOMOUS</b> makes a vehicle request an user defined AI which has to control the vehicle on its own.
                    Therefore this mode allows to request data about the state of a vehicle, its sensors or (for checking additional test criteria) the environment.<br />
                    The mode <b>TRAINING</b> is a combination of MANUAL and AUTONOMOUS.
                    In this mode a vehicle drives as it would be in mode MANUAL but it also makes requests to a dummy AI which can collect all kinds of data as in mode AUTONOMOUS.
                    Any control commands which the dummy AI sends are ignored by DriveBuild.<br />
                    The mode <b>_BEAMNG</b> is a special type of TRAINING mode.
                    In contrast to the mode TRAINING this mode utilizes the BeamNG.AI which has perfect knowledge about all lanes and thus has perfect lane keeping capabilities.
                    So in this mode it is sufficient to specify a goal position where the vehicle has to head to.
                    Still a vehicle does not consider any obstacles or other participants.
                    The mechanism of collecting training data is the same as in mode TRAINING.
